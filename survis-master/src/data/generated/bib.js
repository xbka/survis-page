        "abstract": "We present a new real-time hand tracking system based on a single depth camera. The system can accurately reconstruct complex hand poses across a variety of subjects. It also allows for robust tracking, rapidly recovering from any temporary failures. Most uniquely, our tracker is highly flexible, dramatically improving upon previous approaches which have focused on front-facing close-range scenarios. This flexibility opens up new possibilities for human-computer interaction with examples including tracking at distances from tens of centimeters through to several meters (for controlling the TV at a distance), supporting tracking using a moving depth camera (for mobile scenarios), and arbitrary camera placements (for VR headsets). These features are achieved through a new pipeline that combines a multi-layered discriminative reinitialization strategy for per-frame pose estimation, followed by a generative model-fitting stage. We provide extensive technical details and a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis.",

        "abstract": "Compared with the traditional interaction approaches, such as keyboard, mouse, pen, etc, vision based hand interaction is more natural and efficient. In this paper, we proposed a robust real-time hand gesture recognition method. In our method, firstly, a specific gesture is required to trigger the hand detection followed by tracking; then hand is segmented using motion and color cues; finally, in order to break the limitation of aspect ratio encountered in most of learning based hand gesture methods, the scale-space feature detection is integrated into gesture recognition. Applying the proposed method to navigation of image browsing, experimental results show that our method achieves satisfactory performance.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for tracking a hand while it is interacting with an object. This setting is arguably the one where hand-tracking has most practical relevance, but poses significant additional challenges: strong occlusions by the object as well as self-occlusions are the norm, and classical anatomical constraints need to be softened due to the external forces between hand and object. To achieve robustness to partial occlusions, we use an individual local tracker for each segment of the articulated structure. The segments are connected in a pairwise Markov random field, which enforces the anatomical hand structure through soft constraints on the joints between adjacent segments. The most likely hand configuration is found with belief propagation. Both range and color data are used as input. Experiments are presented for synthetic data with ground truth and for real data of people manipulating objects.",

It tracks a fully articulated hand under large viewpoints in realtime (25 FPS on a desktop without using a GPU) and with high accuracy (error below 10 mm). To our knowledge, it is the first system that achieves such robustness, accuracy, and speed simultaneously, as verified on challenging real data. Our system is made of several novel techniques. We model a hand simply using a number of spheres and define a fast cost function. Those are critical for realtime performance. We propose a hybrid method that combines gradient based and stochastic optimization methods to achieve fast convergence and good accuracy. We present new finger detection and hand initialization methods that greatly enhance the robustness of tracking.",

        "abstract": "Hand-object interaction plays a very important role when humans manipulate objects. While existing methods focus on improving hand-object recognition with fully automatic methods, human intention has been largely neglected in the recognition process, thus leading to undesirable interaction descriptions. To better interpret human-object interaction that is aligned to human intention, we argue that a reference specifying human intention should be taken into account. Thus, we propose a new approach to represent interactions while reflecting human purpose with three key factors, i.e., hand, object and reference. Specifically, we design a pattern of < hand-object, object-reference, hand, object, reference > (HOR) to recognize intention based atomic hand-object interactions. This pattern aims to model interactions with the states of hand, object, reference and their relationships. Furthermore, we design a simple yet effective Spatially Part-based (3+1)D convolutional neural network, namely SP(3+1)D, which leverages 3D and 1D convolutions to model visual dynamics and object position changes based on our HOR, respectively. With the help of our SP(3+1)D network, the recognition results are able to indicate human purposes accurately. To evaluate the proposed method, we annotate a Something-1.3k dataset, which contains 10 atomic hand-object interactions and about 130 videos for each interaction. Experimental results on Something-1.3k demonstrate the effectiveness of our SP(3+1)D network.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based 3D hand tracking is a key and popular component for interaction studies in a broad range of domains such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and natural human-computer interaction (HCI). While this research field has been well studied in the last decades, most approaches have considered the human hand in isolation and not in action or in interaction with the surrounding environment. Even the common collaborative and strong interactions with the other hand have been ignored. However, many of today's computer applications require more and more hand-object interactions. Furthermore, employing contextual information about the object in the hand (e.g. the shape, the texture, and the pose) can remarkably constrain the tracking problem. The most studied contextual constraints involve interaction with real objects and not with virtual objects which is still a very big challenge. The goal of this survey is to develop an up-to-date taxonomy of the state-of-the-art vision-based hand pose estimation and tracking methods with a new classification scheme: hand-object interaction constraints. This taxonomy allows us to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the current state of the art and to highlight future trends in the domain.",
