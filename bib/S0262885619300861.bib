abstract = {Vision-based 3D hand tracking is a key and popular component for interaction studies in a broad range of domains such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and natural human-computer interaction (HCI). While this research field has been well studied in the last decades, most approaches have considered the human hand in isolation and not in action or in interaction with the surrounding environment. Even the common collaborative and strong interactions with the other hand have been ignored. However, many of today's computer applications require more and more hand-object interactions. Furthermore, employing contextual information about the object in the hand (e.g. the shape, the texture, and the pose) can remarkably constrain the tracking problem. The most studied contextual constraints involve interaction with real objects and not with virtual objects which is still a very big challenge. The goal of this survey is to develop an up-to-date taxonomy of the state-of-the-art vision-based hand pose estimation and tracking methods with a new classification scheme: hand-object interaction constraints. This taxonomy allows us to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the current state of the art and to highlight future trends in the domain.}
